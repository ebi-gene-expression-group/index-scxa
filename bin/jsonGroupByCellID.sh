# Explanations for model 4:
# Group by makes arrays of entries grouped by .cell_id and .experiment_accession
# .[] iterates one by one over the arrays created, so that
# map([ .[] ] | .... ) is operating over a set of entries that all have the same .cell_id and .experiment_accession
#Â inside map, .[] is listing all the elements within that cell_id/experiment accession group
# and then reduce is going through all key-values (so "cell_id": "SRR626171" and "characteristics_cell_type": [ "type1" ] would be key-value pairs)
# and aggregating them -- .[$key] |= ( . + $o[$key] | unique ) -- uniquely if they are not either cell_type nor exp_accession ( see if ). 
# This model relies on being passed an array of json objects each representing a line in the the condensed sdr file, where all fields are arrays
# besides "cell_id" and "experiment_accession".

# Given the functional complexity of jq, I'm leaving the thought process that is not captured by the version control below.

# [group_by([.cell_id, .experiment_accession])] : produced an array for each combination of cell id and experiment accession, so we have an array or arrays.
